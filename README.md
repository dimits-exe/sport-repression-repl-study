# Replication Study for: International Sports Events and Repression in Autocracies: Evidence from the 1978 FIFA World Cup
  
This project attempts to replicate and verify the results and findings of the recent paper 
[International Sports Events and Repression in Autocracies: Evidence from the 1978 FIFA World Cup](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/international-sports-events-and-repression-in-autocracies-evidence-from-the-1978-fifa-world-cup/19FA0D5B0DD55259AA6A3E4FEBB7978A) using the provided
datasets and methodology. 

We recreate the data and graphs used to justify the paper's findings, create and run regression models to verify the statistical plausibility of the findings while including concise descriptions of the ideas and methods used in the original paper.
